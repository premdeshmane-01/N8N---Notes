# Data Flow in n8n



## Flow
1. How data is represented in n8n
2. how the data moves/flows in n8n
3. About expressions, where are they used in workflows.


---

### How data is represented
Data inside n8n is represented as a JSON Object.



**Properties:**

1. JSON is represented using `key:value` pairs.
2. looks very similar to python dictionaries.
3. JSON starts and ends with {...}.
4. Indentation matters in JSON.
5. You can store --> Numbers(int), Floating Point, Arrays(list), Key:Value pairs(JSON objects)


```
{
  "name": "Rahul",
  "age": 30,
  "city_name": "Delhi",
  "friends_list": ["Amit", "Neha", "Vicky"]
}
```

### Control nodes
They are used for **Data Flow management**.



Frequently used control nodes:

1. Merge node
2. IF node
3. Switch node
4. Split node
5. Edit/Set fields node


#### Merge Nodes
Nodes that take input from multiple streams and output a single array of data.

These are your **many to one** type of nodes.



Two types of operations:

1. Append - You combine multiple inputs into an array and the result is an array of inputs.
Stacking the inputs. Concatenating the two inputs
2. Combine - you perform a join operation on inputs

#### IF Node
If else operation.

Based on a certain condition you have two output paths.

True --> True path

False --> False Path

#### Switch Node
if elif else operation

Based on multiple conditions, you select the path

You take the path where the expression evaluates to True

#### Split Node
it is the reverse of merge node. 

it is **one to many** type

you take one item as input and output multiple items

you have single stream of input and the output has multiple streams of data.

#### Edit node
You take in an input and send out a modified output.

you can add attributes, you can modify attributes, update the data.
